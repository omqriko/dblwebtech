			<h1 class="black"> About our project </h1>
			<p class="text black"> The projected was given by the technical university of Eindhoven for the DBL HTI+ webtech course. The aim of the project is to create visualizations for datasets such that they can be explored and investigated. 
			        <br>
			        <br>
			    The default dataset on this website is the enron-v1, a dataset consisting of an e-mail network that 
			    contains approximately 31,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. To visualize such
			    data set and similar data sets of your choice we have used three visualizations: the Zoomable Sunburst 
			    diagram, the Zoomable Circle Packing diagram and The interactive Node Link diagram. All of which are built on hierarchical clustering. On
			    the enron data set the hierarchy is built based on the job titles of the employees with the first level
			    being the senders and the second level being the receivers.
