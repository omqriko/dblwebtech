NOTE
For an unknown reason, most likely due to securtiy measures, our hosted DBL project website (the link above) does not work on the TU/e wifi (connection).
We tested this on the university and the page will keep loading forever and never load.
This is not the case on other connections. In case of doubt, one could use a mobile hotspot which will work.

Loading the website manual on a localhost can be done by going into the public_html folder and opening the index.html file.
